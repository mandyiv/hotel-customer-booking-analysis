# **Hospitality Customer Booking Analysis**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project explores hotel booking data to understand **booking patterns, customer behavior, and factors influencing reservations**. The insights derived will help hotels **optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue**.  

Using **SQL for data preprocessing, Power BI for visualization, and Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, we uncover key trends in hotel reservations.  

---

## **Dataset & Features**  
The dataset includes information on hotel reservations, such as:  
- Booking status (canceled or confirmed)  
- Customer demographics  
- Reservation dates and lead times  
- Meal preferences  
- Market segment and distribution channels  
- Special requests and stay durations

## **Key Insights**  
Some notable findings from the analysis include:  
✅ Trends in reservation cancellations and their impact on revenue  
✅ Peak booking periods and seasonal variations  
✅ Customer preferences for room types and meal plans  
✅ The role of lead time in determining booking confirmation rates  
✅ The influence of market segments and distribution channels on hotel revenue
